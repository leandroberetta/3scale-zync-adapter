# 3scale Zync Adapter

This repository is a reference to implement and adapter to integrate Zync with any IdP using OpenID Connect.

The example is made with Keycloak (which is already implemented and supported by 3scale itself, so for Keycloak use the default implementation) just for demo reasons, the idea is to change the application logic to create/update/delete clients according to the IdP required (using the IdP's REST API).
