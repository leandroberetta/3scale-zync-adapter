# 3scale Zync Adapter

Work in progress.

This repository is a reference to implement and adapter to integrate Zync with any IdP using OpenID Connect.

The demonstration is made with Keycloak (which is already implemented and supported in 3scale, use the default implementation!) just for demo reasons, but the idea is to change the application logic to create/update/delete clients according to the IdP required (using the IdP Rest API).
